            <h3>Background Info</h3>

            <p>Road crashes are one of the leading causes of death and serious injury for people aged 16-25. In their first year on the road, young drivers are about three times more likely to be killed or injured than more experienced drivers.</p>

            <p>Young drivers often have the oldest and least safe cars on our roads. This is either because a car's looks and performance are seen as more important than safety, or because price is often the main criteria when choosing a car.</p>

            <p>The TAC has developed a site just for young drivers called <a href='http://www.howsafeisyourfirstcar.com.au'>howsafeisyourfirstcar.com.au</a> (which can be used as a good reference tool). This site allows consumers to search through a database of safe, P-plater approved cars in their budget. The TAC and its road safety partners recommend that consumers look for a minimum 4 star ANCAP safety rating when purchasing a new car. Using Carsales data, it allows people to look for cars in their price range. There is even an under $5,000 category!</p>

            <p>Young drivers' first cars need to be safe. Really safe. Long gone are the days that you look for the cheapest old bomb you can afford.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>How</strong> do you encourage your peers to think about safety before the colour of a vehicle?</li>
                <li><strong>How</strong> do you get young people talking to their parents about safety before making big car purchases?</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> motivates young people to want to stay safe?</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> motivates young people to do the right thing?</li>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>

            <p>Your idea needs to highlight the importance of having either a 4 or 5-star rated car and that a safe car can be affordable and fit within most budgets.</p>

            <p>You idea needs to be creative and have credibility amongst the target audience of 18 - 25 year olds, while not being too preachy.</p>

            <p>The judges are looking for a concept that is portrayed in a positive way rather than using graphic shock tactics.</p>
