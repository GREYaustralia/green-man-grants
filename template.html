        <h1>THE BRIEF</h1>

          <h2>How would you get your peers to understand the importance of buying a safe car?</h2>

          <h3>Background Info</h3>

          <p>Road crashes are one of the leading causes of death and serious injury for people aged 16-25. In their first year on the road, young drivers are about three times more likely to be killed or injured than more experienced drivers.</p>

          <p>Young drivers often have the oldest and least safe cars on our roads. This is either because a car's looks and performance are seen as more important than safety, or because price is often the main criteria when choosing a car.</p>

          <p>The TAC has developed a site just for young drivers called howsafeisyourfirstcar.com.au (which can be used as a good reference tool). This site allows consumers to search though a database of safe, P plater approved cars in their budget. The TAC and its road safety partners recommend that consumers look for a minimum 4 star ANCAP safety rating when purchasing a new car. Using Carsales data, it allows people to look for cars in their price range. There is even an under $5,000 category!</p>

          <p>Young drivers' first cars need to be safe. Really safe. Long gone are the days that you look for the cheapest old bomb you can afford.</p>

          <h3>Criteria</h3>

          <p>Your idea needs to highlight the importance of having either a 4 or 5-star rated car and that a safe car can be affordable and fit within most budgets.</p>

          <p>You idea needs to be creative and have credibility amongst the target audience of 18 - 25 year olds, while not being too preachy.</p>

          <p>The judges are not looking for a “typical” TAC style ad.</p>


          <h3>THE JUDGING</h3>

          <p>Phase 1: All submissions will be evaluated by a judging panel made up of TAC and key road safety partners. All applicants will be notified whether they have been successful or not via email by 14 th October 2016.</p>

          <p>Phase 2: Successful finalists will be required to present their idea to the judging panel - including industry experts. A detailed brief of what will be required will be outlined at this stage. Presentations will be scheduled from 31 st October, 2016. This presentation will require an overview of the concept including a detailed breakdown of the budget funds requested.</p>

          <p>Phase 3: Ten winners will be announced on 14 th November, 2016 and will receive a budget of up to $50,000 to produce their idea. TAC and an industry mentor will work with you in creating your idea and manage the budget. A personal prize of $5,000 will be awarded to you when the idea is complete.</p>
